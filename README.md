# CS-2413-HW
HW from my CS 2413 - Data Structures - Class; S23


# HW 1
Implement simple student and university classes

# HW 2
take a small quiz on Canvas about pointers and iterating them

# HW 3
Dynamically Allocated array of changeable size

# HW 4
Singly-Linked-List List operations
gotta say, it's really hard to reverse a SLL without a stack
What I did definitely wasn't the best or most efficient, but it made the sid link backwards!
